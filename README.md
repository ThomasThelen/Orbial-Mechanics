Space is cool, so are the equations that govern how things move around in it. On the scale of day to day things, the dominating force is gravity. Most of the applications here exploit gravity to do activities such as keeping an orbit, shifting  an orbit, or transfering the orbit to antoher system.

## Reopository Structure
The structure of this repository is subject to change. Currently, each file is a simulation of a system doing _sonething_.

## Sources

I've been using the knowledge gained from [Orbital Mechanics Engineering for Students](https://www.amazon.com/Orbital-Mechanics-Engineering-Students-Aerospace/dp/0080977472/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=orbital+mechanics&qid=1560461247&s=gateway&sr=8-6) to write these scripts.
